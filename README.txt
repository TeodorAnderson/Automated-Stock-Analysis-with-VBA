##Teodor Anderson




Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	Steve, a good friend of mine , graduated with a finance degree and acquired his first clients, his ecologically minded parents, and works to build a diversified portfolio of green energy stocks. He has enlisted my help to analyze a data set of ecological stocks from 2017 and 2018 to find the most successful options. Using VBA to automate excel analysis, my task is to write and refactor macros to extract data from Excel, create dynamic input interactions, and output the total daily volume and its yearly return into clean, visually appealing data back to Excel as quickly as possible.




Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
